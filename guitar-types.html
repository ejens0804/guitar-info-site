            <h3>Semi-Hollow Body Guitars</h3>
            <p><b>Description:</b> Semi-hollow guitars have a solid center block with hollow wings, which allows for a warmer tone compared

            <h3>Hollow Body Guitars</h3>
            <p><b>Description:</b> These guitars are fully hollow with no solid center block.  They provide a resonant acoustic-like tone but can 
            be prone to feedback at high volumes</p>
            <p><b>Typical Uses:</b> Hollow body guitars are primarily used in jazz, blues, and rockabilly due to their warm sound.  They are less common
            in high-gain genres because of feedback issues.</p>
            <p>Each type of electric guitar serves different musical purposes based on its construction and tonal characteristics. Solid body guitars are versatile 
            across many genres, semi-hollow bodies provide warmth suitable for jazz and blues, while hollow bodies excel in delivering rich acoustic-like tones. 
            Selecting the right guitar depends on the player's musical style and personal preferences</p>
