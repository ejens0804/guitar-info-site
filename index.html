            <h4>How does an Electric Guitar work?</h4>
            <p>
                An electric guitar works by converting the mechanical vibrations of its metal strings into electrical signals that can be 
                amplified and played through speakers. Here's a breakdown of the key components and processes involved:
            </p>
            <h4>Pickups: The Heart of the Electric Guitar</h4>
            <p>
                The pickups are the most crucial component in an electric guitar's sound production system.
                They consist of magnets wrapped in coils of wire, which generate an electrical signal when the strings vibrate above them.
                There are typically two types of pickups: single-coil and humbucker. Single-coil pickups produce a bright, clear sound,
                while humbuckers offer a warmer, fuller tone.
                Normally there are multiple pickups positioned under the strings at different points along the guitar body to capture different tonal qualities.

        <section class="content2">
            <h4>How Pickups Function</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The pickups create a magnetic field around the guitar strings.</li>
                <li>When a string vibrates, it disturbs this magnetic field.</li>
                <li>This disturbance induces a small electric current in the pickup's coil.</li>
                <li>The frequency of this current matches the frequency of the vibrating string.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                For example, if you pluck the A string, it vibrates at 440 Hz, inducing an electric current of the same frequency in the pickup.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Signal Processing and Amplification</h4>
            <p>Once the pickups generate the electrical signal, it goes through several stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The signal passes through the guitar's internal circuitry, including volume and tone controls.</li>
                <li>It then travels through the guitar cable to the amplifier.</li>
                <li>A preamplifier boosts the weak signal from the pickups.</li>
                <li>The power amplifier further increases the signal strength.</li>
                <li>Finally, the amplified signal is sent to the speakers, producing the audible sound.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="content3">
            <h4>Additional Components</h4>
            <p>Several other parts of the electric guitar contribute to its functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Bridge:</b> Anchors the strings and affects intonation.</li>
                <li><b>Fretboard:</b> Allows the player to change the pitch of the strings by pressing them against metal frets.</li>
                <li><b>Pickup Selector Switch:</b> Enables the guitarist to choose which pickup(s) to use, affecting the tone.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Unique Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Unlike acoustic guitars, electric guitars don't rely on a hollow body for sound resonance.  This design allows for 
                greater control over the sound and enables effects like distortion and feedback, which are often desirable in certain
                genres of music.
            </p>
            <p>The electric guitar's ability to convert string vibrations into electrical signals is what gives it its versatility and 
                distinctive sound, making it a cornerstone of modern music across numerous genres.
